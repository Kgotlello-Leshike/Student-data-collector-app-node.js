The Student Data Collector App is a simple command-line application built with Node.js to manage student records. This app showcases core data handling techniques, such as collecting, validating, and storing data, and automating operations through a user-friendly interface. These features form a strong foundation for workflows in data science and data engineering, focusing on preprocessing and managing structured datasets.

Features
1. Structured Data Storage
The app uses JSON files to store student records, demonstrating how structured data can be managed and persisted in real-world scenarios.

2. Clean Data Guarantee
It validates user inputs and prevents duplicate records, ensuring the data is clean and consistentâ€”a critical requirement for data preprocessing in analysis pipelines.

3. Data Querying and Retrieval
Users can:

Add new student records.
Retrieve specific student details.
List all students.
Remove unwanted records.
These operations simulate querying and managing datasets, foundational tasks in data wrangling.

4. Automation with CLI
Using the Yargs library, the app provides a command-line interface for executing data operations. This approach automates repetitive tasks, reduces manual intervention, and replicates the efficiency needed in data engineering pipelines.

5. Modular Design
The app's functionality is divided into modules, allowing for scalability and extension. For example, it can easily be adapted to use a database or integrate with APIs for larger datasets.

How This App Relates to Data Science
1. Collecting and Structuring Data
By capturing user input and organizing it in a retrievable JSON format, the app mirrors real-world practices in collecting raw data for analysis.

2. Data Cleaning
Input validation and duplicate prevention demonstrate preprocessing steps required to ensure high-quality data before analysis.

3. Handling Real-World Data Formats
Working with JSON aligns with modern data exchange standards, preparing users to handle similar formats in APIs, web scraping, or big data workflows.

4. Automating Data Pipelines
The CLI design automates data management tasks, showcasing how repetitive preprocessing steps can be streamlined in data engineering.

5. Preparing for Advanced Tools
The structured and clean data created by the app can be exported for deeper analysis or modeling in Python, R, or SQL.

Future Enhancements
